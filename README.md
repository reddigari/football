# football

This collection of python scripts scrapes and parses various NFL datasets from Yahoo and ESPN, including historical and fantasy football data.

Unfortunately, it is not currently organized in any useful way. I intend to turn it into a somewhat contained class at some point, but no promises. In the meantime, the scripts should work (with minor tweaks) for anyone inclined to figure out what they do.

See the `Data` directory for some already scraped and clean datasets.
