`TheOcho2016` & `TheOcho2017` have data from leagues used in the devlopment of [`espnffl`](https://github.com/reddigari/espnffl), a Python module that scrapes and formats data from ESPN fantasy leagues.

`Scripts` is a collection of Python scripts that scrape and parse various [NFL datasets from Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/stats/).

`Data` includes some cleaned datasets (offensive performance, schedules) and raw scraped data.

`Fantasy` has a few miscellaneous scripts and plots exploring patterns and (lack of) predictability in performance. It's a huge mess, and where I throw ideas that crap out. They mostly use the data in `Data`.

`Draft2016` & `Draft2017` have plots of pre-season projections from [Fantasy Football Analytics](http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/)
