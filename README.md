`espnffl` is a python module designed to scrape rosters, projections, and scores for an [ESPN Fantasy Football](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/) league (or the whole NFL). Documentation is forthcoming. See examples of what it does in `TheOcho2016`, which is a real league I'm in this year.

`ScrapeClean` is a collection of python scripts scrapes and parses various [NFL datasets from Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/stats/).

`Data` includes some cleaned datasets (offensive performance, schedules) and raw scraped data.

`Fantasy` has a few miscellaneous scripts and plots exploring patterns and (lack of) predictability in performance. These scripts use the data in `Data`.

`Draft2016` plots pre-season projections from [Fantasy Football Analytics](http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net/)
